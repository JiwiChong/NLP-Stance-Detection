# NLP-Stance-Detection

Stance Detection is a task in which textual processing and interpretability is made in order
to observe the viewpoint and stance that a person makes regarding a target. The target
can range from politicians, environmental campaigns, marketing campaigns, abortion, etc. 
In this repository, a research work of Machine Committee on Stance Detection is provided
in the hopes to promote further research work on Stance Detection.

Particularly, a Decorrelated Ensemble Model composed of multiple BERT models is developed. 
The BERT Decorrelated Ensemble Model outperformed every state-of-the-art Machine Learning and
Deep Learning algorithms for both Semeval-2016 and Will-they-won't-they datasets.

In addition, an explainable Stance Detection is executed in order to illustrate key words that
led to the Stance of the texts.
